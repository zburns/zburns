### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Zachary Burns and I typically go by the nickname "Zack".  I'm from the United States of America and currently reside in the Northwest-Ohio area.

I have been gainfully employed ever since I was 14 years old.  For some reason I have the drive to just work.  I'm a fan of working smarter, not harder, but hard work doesn't deter me!

I've been writing code in some fashion ever since our family acquired a Commodore VIC-20, then the Tandy Model 1000, and of course, sprinkle in the Macintosh IIe and pretty much any technology thereafter and I've written some code for it.  Yes, I've even written an app for the Palm VII called "Comment Card".  (Think "Yelp" only circa June 1999.  I've always been an early adopter, just never had the stomach for a start-up and all the risk involved.

Anyway, I currently build and deliver mission-critical, end-to-end internal business systems and work as a Senior Software Engineer and IT Manager for the world's largest [Midas](http://www.midas.com) franchise.  I enjoy solving problems and have done everything from server, mobile, desktop and even hardware-based development to get the job done.  I like anything technology related (as long as it has been thought out properly and serves a real purpose).

I hold a **Master's Degree in Computer Science** from [Bowling Green State University](http://www.bgsu.edu) with a specialization in Parallel and Distributed Computing, a **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science** with a Minor in Chemistry, and have done Electrical Engineering Master's work at the [University of Toledo](http://www.utoledo.edu).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on sophisticated business growth software using Microsoft C# .NET, Delphi Object Pascal, a little Python and even Artificial Intelligence sprinkled in there somewhere.

Note, that most of my Repositories are PRIVATE due to active and ongoing paid projects.  I'm not against developing and releasing public code, it's just not my personal property at this time.
